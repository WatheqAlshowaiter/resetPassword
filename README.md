# resetPassword
make a reset password functionality using PHPMailer

this is practicing after Reece Kenny lessons (highly recommended) in [this link](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BLwhJYEOVE4&list=PLy9OqUw9V30b4YiPEnG75T6jd0WBA6UEv). 

this just for dev purpose, so it is not very secure. 

## to make function in your host 

- import the resetPassword.sql to your MYSQL database
- change config.php to what you database settings 
- add the smtp settings you will use (I am using gmail smtp) 

if somethings misunderstood you can refered to the [playlist](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BLwhJYEOVE4&list=PLy9OqUw9V30b4YiPEnG75T6jd0WBA6UEv) of vides from Reece and [PHPMailer](https://github.com/PHPMailer/PHPMailer) Readme in Github.
